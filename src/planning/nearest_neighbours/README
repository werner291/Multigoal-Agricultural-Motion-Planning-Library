Files in this directory are "stolen" from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) project, because we needed a simple
nearest neighbor data structure for our implementation of some of the planning algorithms, but we did not want to
introduce a dependency on OMPL. The files are copied from the OMPL project and are licensed under the BSD license.

Credit for the implementation goes to the OMPL developers, of course. The original files can be found in the OMPL project.
